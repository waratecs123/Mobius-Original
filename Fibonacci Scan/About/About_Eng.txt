Fibonacci Scan is a powerful generator and scanner of QR codes for PC,
which goes beyond standard functions. The application allows
you to create both simple static codes and dynamic QR links
with statistics tracking, editable content, and password protection.
All popular formats are supported: from URL and vCard contacts to
WiFi authorization and crypto payments, and the built-in editor gives the opportunity
to customize the design (logos, gradients, shaped patterns) without loss of
readability.

The program stands out with unique functions, such as AI code optimization
for scanning even when partially damaged, batch generation for
mass tasks, and deep analytics with scan geography.
For security, data encryption, code expiration dates, and password protection are provided.
Fibonacci Scan also supports rare formats like Aztec Code
and works offline, making it a universal tool for business,
events, and personal use.

Fibonacci Scan offers a flexible access model: the free version covers
basic needs, and a paid subscription or one-time purchase unlocks premium templates,
API integration, and remote code management. The application is optimized for
low-spec PCs, supports 24 languages, and has a special mode for people with disabilities.
It is the ideal solution for those who want to turn QR codes into
a convenient and secure digital tool.
