Newton Flow is an interactive mini-type pad for PC that turns an ordinary
touchpad (or even a laptop's touch panel) into a compact MIDI controller
for creating beats, samples, and electronic music. Inspired by
tools like the AKAI MPC or Novation's Launchpad, it allows you to play
drums, launch loops, and record patterns right under your fingers – without
buying additional equipment.

The application emulates a grid of pads (4x4, 8x8, or a customizable option) with
tactile feedback (vibration response) and visual highlighting of presses. You
can load your own samples, adjust touch sensitivity,
or use the built-in library of presets (kick drums, hi-hats,
synth basses). Newton Flow BeatPad supports MIDI output, integration
with DAWs (FL Studio, Ableton Live), and even a function for recording live jams in WAV/MP3.

The free version includes basic functions, and a paid upgrade unlocks
multi-touch mode, advanced sampling, and AI beat generation. It's the ideal
tool for beatmakers on the go – you can tap out beats even on a bus,
using just your laptop's touchpad!
