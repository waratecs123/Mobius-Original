Lumière Cut is a professional video editing application for PC,
created for those looking for a powerful and convenient video processing tool.
In terms of functionality, it is comparable to Adobe Premiere Pro and CapCut, combining
advanced capabilities for professionals and an intuitive interface
for beginners. The program supports multi-track editing, work with 4K and
HDR video, and offers a wide selection of effects, transitions, and color correction
for creating high-quality content.

A distinctive feature of Lumière Cut is its optimization for different user levels.
It has both automatic functions in the spirit of CapCut (e.g., smart cropping,
social media templates, and AI stabilization) and manual settings familiar to
Premiere Pro users (color curves, keyframes, mask work). The application also
supports plugins and integration with other programs, making it a flexible
solution for videographers, bloggers, and editors.

Another plus of Lumière Cut is its accessibility. Unlike many professional
editors, the program offers free basic functionality with the possibility of expansion
through a subscription or one-time purchases of add-ons. It works even on mid-budget
PCs thanks to competent optimization, and cloud project saving allows for easy
switching between devices. It's an excellent choice for those who want a powerful
video editor without unnecessary complexity.
