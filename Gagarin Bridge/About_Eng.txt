Gagarin Bridge is a universal file converter for PC,
which allows you to quickly and easily convert media files,
documents, images, and archives between hundreds of formats.
The program supports all popular data types – from video
(MP4, AVI, MKV) and audio (MP3, FLAC, WAV) to PDF, DOCX, JPG,
PNG, and even specialized formats like PSD or CAD.
Gagarin Bridge is distinguished by high processing speed thanks to
multithreaded technologies and hardware acceleration, making it
an excellent alternative to online converters and bulky
professional solutions.

The application offers not only basic conversion but also
advanced settings – lossless compression, video resolution change,
audio track extraction, file merging, and batch processing.
The user can finely tune the output file parameters (bitrate,
sampling rate, codec, etc.), and a built-in preview allows
you to immediately evaluate the result.

Gagarin Bridge combines simplicity and power: an intuitive interface makes
it accessible for beginners, while advanced features will be useful for IT specialists
and designers. The program works without a subscription – you can buy a license once
or use the free version with a file size limit.
Support for the Russian language, regular updates, and low system requirements
make Gagarin Bridge one of the best offline converters for everyday
and professional tasks.
