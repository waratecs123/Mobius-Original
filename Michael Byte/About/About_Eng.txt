Michael Byte is a powerful desktop tool within the Mobius ecosystem, designed for
professional and convenient work with text layers on images. Unlike
mobile counterparts, it offers the full control of a PC: precise positioning
with a mouse, hotkey support, and high-resolution project handling.
You can easily import images in JPG, PNG, or PSD formats and gain full control
over adding, editing, and styling any captions, making it an ideal
solution for creating memes, social media posts, watermarks, or design elements.

The tool is deeply integrated into the Mobius ecosystem, which is its key
advantage. Finished works can be exported to other system applications with one click.
Thanks to the unified Mobius Cloud storage, all your fonts and projects are synchronized
between devices, allowing you to start work on one device and finish on another.

Michael Byte goes beyond basic text addition, offering an extended set of features
for fine typography. This includes advanced layer management, a wide selection of fonts
with support for fill, stroke, shadows, and leading, as well as text warp tools
and transparency control. Created specifically for creators within the comprehensive ecosystem,
it bridges the gap between simple mobile editors and complex graphics packages,
offering the perfect balance of simplicity and functionality for fast and high-quality
visual content design.
