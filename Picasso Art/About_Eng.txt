Picasso Art is a professional graphics editor for PC,
inspired by the capabilities of Adobe Photoshop but created for
a broader audience – from digital artists to photographers
and designers. The program supports working with layers, masks,
smart objects, and advanced retouching tools, allowing for the
creation of complex compositions and realistic photomontages. Thanks to
support for graphics tablets and pen pressure sensitivity,
Picasso Art is excellent for digital painting, illustration, and
concept art.

A distinctive feature of Picasso Art is the combination of professional
functions with an accessible interface. It has everything you need: curves,
levels, color correction, filters (including a Content-Aware Fill equivalent),
as well as unique AI tools for automatic photo enhancement,
background removal, and image element generation. Unlike Photoshop,
the program offers a more intuitive menu.

Picasso Art operates on a hybrid model: there is a free version with basic
features and a paid subscription (or one-time purchase) that unlocks access
to advanced tools, exclusive brushes, and presets. The program
is optimized to work even on low-spec PCs, supports GPU acceleration, and
cloud project saving. With Picasso Art, you don't need expensive licenses – it's
a powerful alternative to Photoshop for those who want professional results without
unnecessary complexity.
