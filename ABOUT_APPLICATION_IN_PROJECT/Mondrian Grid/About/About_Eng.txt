Mondrian Grid is a professional color analysis and palette management
application developed in Python. The program provides a comprehensive
set of tools for extracting dominant colors from images, generating
color harmonies, and creating thematic color schemes. The interface
features a dark color scheme with indigo accents, ensuring comfortable
use during extended sessions.

The application supports image analysis using the K-means algorithm
for accurate identification of main colors, palette mood classification,
and harmony generation based on various schemes (analogous, complementary,
triadic, and others). Mondrian Grid is equipped with advanced tools
for conversion between color models (HEX, RGB, HSL) and contrast
checking according to WCAG standards.

Mondrian Grid stands out with its optimized architecture â€“ it includes
a palette history system with automatic saving, a theme constructor
for web design, and support for export to various formats (CSS, SCSS,
GIMP Palette, JSON, PNG). The application is suitable for both quick
image analysis and professional color work in design and interface
development.
