Tarantino Catch is your digital director, instantly capturing the
creative process right from the screen. The tool allows you to simultaneously
record video from a webcam to capture your emotions and reactions,
and the window of any application on the computer – be it a sequencer,
graphics editor, or game engine. All this is combined into one
synchronized video stream, creating dynamic and lively content,
perfect for creating lessons, demonstrations, and vlogs without
the need for complex editing.

The flexibility of recording settings makes the process intuitive and powerful.
You can easily select the desired program window or screen area,
as well as turn the camera recording on or off with one click. Before starting,
you can set the resolution, frame rate, and sound sources – system
audio stream and your voice from the microphone – the balance between which is adjusted
with simple sliders. This simplicity allows you not to be distracted by technical
details and fully focus on creativity.

Integration with the Mobius ecosystem turns Tarantino Catch into a starting point
for any project. The finished video material instantly becomes an asset within
the platform: it can be immediately dragged into the Mobius editor for further editing,
applying effects, color correction, or synchronization with music. This creates
a seamless workflow – from idea and primary recording to final render,
making the creation of professional content incredibly fast and exciting.
