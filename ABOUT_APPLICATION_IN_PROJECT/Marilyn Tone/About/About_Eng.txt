Marilyn Tone is an innovative PC application that
converts text into expressive speech and vice versa (speech to text)
with support for voices of different characters. Unlike standard
speech synthesizers, here you can choose not just voices, but
entire personas – from a strict professor to a perky
animated character, including famous vocal manners
(e.g., a languid whisper, dramatic declamation, or energetic
advertising delivery).

The program uses neural network technologies for the most
natural sound: you can adjust the emotional coloring
(joy, sarcasm, sadness), pace, timbre, and even the "age" of the voice.
The reverse function – converting speech to text – supports dialects,
homonyms, and work in a noisy environment.

Marilyn Tone operates on a subscription basis with a free trial period.
It integrates with players, presentation programs, and even
game engines, allowing you to voice content without studio recording.
For bloggers, voice-over actors, and educational content creators
– it's a multi-tool for working with voice, replacing a whole set of
professional tools.
